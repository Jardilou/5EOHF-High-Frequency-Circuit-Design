# 5EOHF-High-Frequency-Circuit-Design
The goal of this project is to create a pcb using an ESP32 microcontroller and able to send gps signals via LoRa communication. Two circuits will be fabricated separately, the first one for the microcontroller and the associated modules and the second one for the design of the antenna.

## 1. Project description
The components required for the main pcb assemply are listed in the BOM. Mainly, the modules are :
- GPS : SAM-M8Q-0
- ESP32 S3
- Lora Module RFM95 (868 MHz - without antenna, to be designed)
- Battery Power management 2S – BQ 25798
- USBC charging and programming pin
- SMA for custom antenna (868 MHz)

## 2. Schematic and Printed Circuit Board
